   Contingency: Hybrid approach with RF assistance
   
3. Competitor with superior technology emerges
   Contingency: Focus on niche applications, consider acquisition
   
4. Supply chain disruptions
   Contingency: Dual-source all critical components
   
5. Safety incident during testing
   Contingency: Transparent investigation, design modifications

3. Clinical/regulatory to quality/regulatory departments
4. Testing team to manufacturing quality control
```

12.3 Lessons Learned Process

```
Post-Project Review (Month 37):
1. Technical lessons (what worked, what didn't)
2. Process lessons (development methodology effectiveness)
3. Team performance (skills gaps, collaboration)
4. Risk management (identification and mitigation)
5. Financial management (budget accuracy, cost controls)

Knowledge Base Creation:
- Document lessons in searchable database
