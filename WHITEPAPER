1. Introduction & Motivation

1.1 The Wireless Power Landscape

The global wireless power transmission market is projected to reach $35.2 billion by 2028, driven by increasing demand for contactless charging solutions across multiple industries. While inductive and resonant magnetic coupling dominate near-field applications (<10 cm), and radio frequency (RF) methods address longer distances with lower efficiency, a significant technology gap exists for medium-range (10 cm to 10 m) applications requiring safety, precision, and operation in electromagnetically challenging environments.

1.2 The Acoustic Advantage

Ultrasonic Energy Transfer addresses this gap by utilizing mechanical pressure waves in the 20 kHz to 2 MHz range. The fundamental advantages include:

· Medium Penetration: Effective transmission through biological tissue, water, and certain materials opaque to electromagnetic waves
· Safety Profile: Lower risk of thermal or electromagnetic interference with sensitive electronics and biological systems
· Precision Beamforming: Sub-wavelength focusing capabilities due to shorter acoustic wavelengths compared to RF at similar frequencies
· Regulatory Simplicity: Less congested frequency spectrum with fewer licensing requirements

1.3 Historical Context

The piezoelectric effect, discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880, forms the physical basis for UET. While ultrasound has been utilized extensively for imaging and non-destructive testing since the mid-20th century, its application for meaningful energy transfer has only recently become feasible through advances in materials science, power electronics, and digital signal processing.

2. Fundamental Principles of Acoustic Energy Transfer

2.1 The Piezoelectric Transduction Chain

UET systems implement a bidirectional energy conversion process:

```
Electrical Domain → Mechanical Domain → Acoustic Domain → Medium → 
Acoustic Domain → Mechanical Domain → Electrical Domain
```

Transmitter Operation:

V_{in}(t) \xrightarrow{Piezoelectric\ Effect} \epsilon(t) \xrightarrow{Mechanical\ Coupling} p(t)


Where:

· V_{in}(t) = Input electrical voltage
· \epsilon(t) = Mechanical strain in piezoelectric material
· p(t) = Acoustic pressure wave

The governing equation for piezoelectric transduction is:

D = \epsilon^T E + dT



S = dE + s^E T


Where:

· D = Electric displacement
· E = Electric field
· T = Mechanical stress
· S = Mechanical strain
· d = Piezoelectric charge coefficient
· \epsilon^T = Permittivity at constant stress
· s^E = Compliance at constant electric field

2.2 Acoustic Wave Propagation

The acoustic pressure field p(\mathbf{r}, t) in a homogeneous, lossy medium satisfies the inhomogeneous wave equation:

\nabla^2 p(\mathbf{r}, t) - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 p(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t^2} = -\rho_0 \frac{\partial q(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t}

For harmonic time dependence e^{j\omega t}, the Helmholtz equation describes propagation:

(\nabla^2 + k^2) p(\mathbf{r}) = 0

Where the complex wavenumber k accounts for attenuation:

k = \frac{\omega}{c} - j\alpha

The attenuation coefficient \alpha in air follows a frequency-squared dependence:

\alpha_{air} \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-11} f^2 \quad \text{[Np/m]}


where f is frequency in Hz.

2.3 Acoustic Impedance Matching

The severe impedance mismatch between piezoelectric materials (∼30 MRayl) and air (∼400 Rayl) represents the primary engineering challenge. The power transmission coefficient between two media is:

\tau = \frac{4Z_1 Z_2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}

For direct PZT-to-air coupling, \tau \approx 5 \times 10^{-5}, necessitating impedance matching layers. A quarter-wave matching layer with impedance Z_m = \sqrt{Z_1 Z_2} optimizes energy transfer, with multi-layer broadband matching further improving performance.

4. Performance Characteristics & Limitations

4.1 Efficiency Analysis

System Efficiency Decomposition:

\eta_{system} = \eta_{elec-ac} \times \eta_{prop} \times \eta_{ac-elec} \times \eta_{conv}

Where:

· \eta_{elec-ac} = Electrical to acoustic conversion (75-85%)
· \eta_{prop} = Propagation efficiency (distance and medium dependent)
· \eta_{ac-elec} = Acoustic to electrical conversion (70-80%)
· \eta_{conv} = Power conversion efficiency (85-95%)

Propagation Loss Model:
For a directional transmitter with gain G_t illuminating a receiver of area A_r at distance d:

P_r = P_t \frac{G_t A_r}{4\pi d^2} e^{-2\alpha d}

The effective transmission gain is:

G_{eff} = \frac{A_t A_r}{\lambda^2 d^2} e^{-2\alpha d}

Where A_t is the transmitter aperture area.

5. Advanced Beamforming & Control Systems

5.1 Adaptive Beamforming Algorithms

5.1.1 Time-Reversal Focusing
The time-reversal operator T applied to received signals s_i(t) from initial transmission:

T[s_i(t)] = s_i(-t)

When retransmitted, this creates constructive interference at the receiver location. The focusing gain is:

G_{TR} = \frac{N^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N |\Gamma_{ij}|}

Where \Gamma_{ij} is the correlation between channels i and j, and N is the number of array elements.

5.1.2 Synthetic Aperture Beamforming
For moving receivers or transmitters, synthetic aperture techniques improve resolution:

p_{SA}(x,y) = \sum_{n=1}^N p_n \left( t + \frac{\sqrt{(x-x_n)^2 + (y-y_n)^2}}{c} \right)

5.2 Multi-User Interference Management

5.2.1 Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
Orthogonal coding separates multiple receivers:

s_i(t) = m(t) \cdot c_i(t)

Where m(t) is the modulation and c_i(t) is the orthogonal code for receiver i. The cross-correlation between codes satisfies:

\int_0^T c_i(t) c_j(t) dt = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } i = j \\
0 & \text{if } i \neq j
\end{cases}

5.2.2 Null Steering
Creating nulls at interference locations while maintaining gain at desired receivers:

\mathbf{w} = \frac{\mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{a}(\theta_d)}{\mathbf{a}^H(\theta_d) \mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{a}(\theta_d)}

Where:

· \mathbf{w} = Complex weight vector
· \mathbf{R} = Interference-plus-noise covariance matrix
· \mathbf{a}(\theta_d) = Steering vector toward desired direction

5.3 Environmental Adaptation

5.3.1 Temperature Compensation
Piezoelectric properties vary with temperature according to:

f_r(T) = f_{r0} \left[ 1 + \alpha_f (T - T_0) \right]

Where \alpha_f \approx -100 ppm/°C for PZT. Real-time temperature monitoring and frequency adjustment maintain resonance.

5.3.2 Humidity Compensation
Attenuation in air varies with relative humidity (RH):

\alpha_{air}(f, RH, T) = \frac{f^2}{c} \left[ \frac{1.84 \times 10^{-11}}{1 + (f/f_{rot})^2} + \frac{0.0128 \times e^{-2239/T}}{f_{vib}^2 + f^2} \right]

Where f_{rot} and f_{vib} are relaxation frequencies dependent on RH and temperature.

6. Safety Considerations & Regulatory Framework

6.1 Bioeffects & Exposure Limits

6.1.1 Thermal Mechanisms

TI = \frac{W_{deg}}{W_{ref}}

Where W_{deg} is the derated power and W_{ref} is the power required to raise tissue temperature by 1°C. For diagnostic ultrasound, FDA limits TI < 6.0.

6.1.2 Mechanical Mechanisms
The mechanical index (MI) predicts cavitation risk:

MI = \frac{p_{r.3}}{\sqrt{f}}

Where p_{r.3} is the derated peak rarefactional pressure in MPa and f is frequency in MHz. FDA limits MI < 1.9 for diagnostic applications.
