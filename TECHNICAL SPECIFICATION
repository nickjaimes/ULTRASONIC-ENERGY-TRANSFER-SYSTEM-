APPENDIX A: ACOUSTIC FORMULAE & CALCULATIONS

Transmission Efficiency Calculation:

```
η_total = η_transducer × η_propagation × η_receiver
η_propagation = e^(-2αd) × (A_transmitter/A_receiver)
α = 0.01 × f^2 (dB/m) for air at 20°C, 50% RH
```

Where:

· η_transducer = 0.85 (transmitter efficiency)
· η_receiver = 0.80 (receiver efficiency)
· α = attenuation coefficient
· f = frequency (MHz)
· d = distance (m)
· A = aperture area

Beam Width Calculation:

```
θ = 1.22 × (λ/D) (radians)
```

Where:

· λ = wavelength in medium (c_air/f)
· D = transmitter array diameter
· c_air = speed of sound in air (~343 m/s at 20°C)

Maximum Safe Exposure:

```
P_max = ISPTA_limit × A_receiver × duty_cycle
```

Where ISPTA_limit = 720 mW/cm² for medical applications
